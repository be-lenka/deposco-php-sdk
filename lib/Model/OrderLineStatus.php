/**
 * Deposco API
 *
 * Welcome to the Deposco API Reference! The Deposco API enables you to integrate your system with Deposco.  * Integrate a product information system (PIM) by creating and retrieving data for items, packs, UPCs, and kits. * Set up warehouse data by creating facilities, zones, locations, and storage details. * Create inbound orders that can be received and outbound orders that can be fulfilled with Deposco warehouse management processes.  This reference provides details on available operations, endpoints, parameters, schemas, and responses.  Example requests and responses are also available for you to use as a reference. You can copy the examples to use as a starting point for your own requests.  Review the guides to learn how the API is used in common business scenarios such as setting up the warehouse and integrating a Product Information Management (PIM) system.  When you're ready to get started, register for a developer account and then log in to create your application in the developer portal.
