This reference provides details on available operations, endpoints, parameters, schemas, and responses.  Example requests and responses are also available for you to use as a reference. You can copy the examples to use as a starting point for your own requests.  Review the guides to learn how the API is used in common business scenarios such as setting up the warehouse and integrating a Product Information Management (PIM) system.
